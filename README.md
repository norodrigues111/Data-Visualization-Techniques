CCT College Dublin Continuous Assessment | Assignment Title: CA1_DVis_HDip_Lvl8 

Scenario:

You have been retained by a retail company to analyse a dataset based on board games. This analysis will help determine the sales strategy for the company in their upcoming Winter season.

Each answer MUST have a separate visualization that can be easily understood, visually represents the answer, and all data wrangling, analysis, and visualizations must generated using python.

The companies CTO also requires you to rationalize all the decisions that you have made in your report.

This rationalization MUST include your visualization design decisions, how you have engineered the data, feature selection and any other information that you deem relevant.

Requirements:

You are required to use the dataset contained within the file “board_games.csv” and then answer the following questions:

Part 1: (Column Names are denoted by quotation marks) (30 marks)

• What are the top 5 “average rated” games?
• Is there a correlation between the “users_rated” and the “max_playtime”?
• What is the distribution of game categories? (You may not use a barchart)
• Do older games (1992 and earlier) have a higher MEDIAN “average rating” than newer games (after 1992)?
• What are the 5 most common “mechanics” in the dataset?

Part 2 (20 marks)

• You must answer a “Statistically Relevant” question, OF YOUR OWN CHOOSING, using the dataset, that has not been asked in Part 1. This must have a logical basis that enhances the information and insight gained in the scenario.

Part3: (50 marks)

You must explain, in detail,
• why you chose a specific method to engineer the data and how you achieved this in python (Part 1/Part 2)
• why you chose your specific visualizations to illustrate each answer (Part 1/Part 2)
• what design decisions you made for each visualization (for example, but not only: colour, font, titles, size, text position, font size etc) (Part 1/Part 2)
• what your rationale is for the visualization created in Part 2 and how your question enhances the information and insight gained in the scenario (Part 2)
